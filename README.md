# R(ust)ay Tracing in One  Weekend


I looked at the world and thought, 'Just one more ray tracer, and it will be complete'.
Here is my implementation of Peter Shirleys "Ray Tracing in One weekend" !<br/>
I have thoroughly enjoyed myself,
Here is a link to it https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html

  
### Build + Run

`cargo build`  <br  />

`cargo run > image.ppm` (i will make this better)

 <br  />

I suppose my biggest regret is not doing this sooner.
(Such that this code could have join the many other ray tracers in the Artic Code vault, to be preserved for 100's of years)
